Task 1
Numerically solve the differential equation 
y' = 3x -y/x, y(1) = 1
on the segment [1;2] with step 2 by the Euler method and the modified method Euler. Find the exact solution of y(x) and compare the values of the exact and approximate solutions at the point x = 2. Find the absolute and relative errors at this point for each method. Calculations should be carried out with four decimal places.

Task 2
Using the Runge-Kutta method, integrate the following differential equation:
y ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤=‚àí16y+sin(x),y(0)=1,y (0)=‚àí2
on the interval [0;0.3] with a step size h=0.1.
Find the analytical solution y=y(x) of the given equation and compare the values of the exact solution and the approximate numerical solution at the points: ùë•1=0.1, ùë•2=0.2, ùë•3=0.3.
All calculations must be performed to six decimal places.
