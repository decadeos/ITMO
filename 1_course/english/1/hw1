1. Good morning! My name's Anastasia Ohrimenko. I was born in St.Petersburg, in Russia. I live in this city 17 years. My English is bad, because I studied a lot of French.
2. In my free time I like to play guitar, tetris, voleyball and go out with my frends. Also I like to learn new things about programming and science. I believe that there will be more free time in my life.
3. My English classes are at 8 AM on Saturdays. Sometimes it's very difficult to wake up at this time, but I want to solve problems in English and go to study. I have problems knowind the vocabulary and grammar in the language, so I try to prectice more.
