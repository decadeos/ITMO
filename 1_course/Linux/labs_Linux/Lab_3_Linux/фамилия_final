Neo:  [nods]
The Oracle:  What happens when you go through the door?
Neo:  I see Trinity, and something happens, something bad. She starts to fall, and then I wake up.
The Oracle:  Do you see her die?
Neo:  No.
The Oracle:  You have the sight now, Neo. You are looking at the world without time.
Neo:  Then why can’t I see what happens to her?
The Oracle:  We can never see past the choices we don’t understand.
Neo:  Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?
The Oracle:  No. You’ve already made the choice, now you have to understand it.
Neo:  No, I can’t do that. I won’t.
The Oracle:  You have to.
Neo:  Why?
The Oracle:  Because you’re The One.
Neo:  What if I can’t? What happens if I fail?
The Oracle:  Then Zion will fall. Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo. You can save Zion if you reach The Source, but to do that you will need the Keymaker.
Neo:  The Keymaker?
