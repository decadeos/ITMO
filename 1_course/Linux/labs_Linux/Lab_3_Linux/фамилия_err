Link:  Yes sir?
Morpheus:  Given your situation, I can’t say I fully understand your reasons for volunteering to operate onboard my ship. However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
Link:  Yes, sir, I will, sir… I mean, I do, sir.
Morpheus:  I hope so. Now re-patch the main AC to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast.
Link:  Yes, sir.
Trinity:  Still can’t sleep? You wanna talk?
