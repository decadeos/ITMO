Hi Micael
My name's Anastasia. I'm 17. I'm from St-Petersburg, Russia. I'm student in the ITMO University. I work as a tutor in informatics. I'm learning English to talk to my friends.

I live with my parents. My mum is engineer. My dad works on the development team. My sister studies at the University of Economics

I have a lot of time because I'm not studying well, so I go to work at this time. I also work as an assistant in the laboratory. What do you think about horse riding?

Please write soon.

Best wishes
Anastasia
